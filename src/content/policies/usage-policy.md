# Usage Policy

Short version: crates.io is a critical resource for the Rust ecosystem, which hosts a variety of packages from a diverse group of users. That resource is only effective when our users are able to work together as part of a community in good faith. While using crates.io, you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policies, which include some restrictions on content and conduct on crates.io related to user safety, intellectual property, privacy, authenticity, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other!

We do not allow content or activity on crates.io that:

violates the Code of Conduct of the Rust project
is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities, incurring legal liability in the countries the Rust Foundation officially operates in
is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent
amounts to phishing or attempted phishing

unlawfully shares unauthorized product licensing keys, software for generating unauthorized product licensing keys, or software for bypassing checks for product licensing keys, including extension of a free license beyond its trial period
contains malicious code, such as computer viruses, computer worms, rootkits, back doors, or spyware, including content submitted for research purposes (tools designed and documented explicitly to assist in security research are acceptable, but exploits and malware that use the crates.io registry as a deployment or delivery vector are not)

spamming

is not functionally compatible with the cargo build tool (for example, a "package" cannot simply be a PNG or JPEG image, a movie file, or a text document uploaded directly to the registry)
is abusing the package index for purposes it was not intended
You are responsible for using crates.io in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and all of our policies. These policies may be updated from time to time. We will interpret our policies and resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole. The crates.io team reserves the possibility to evaluate each instance on a case-by-case basis.

For issues such as DMCA violations, or trademark and copyright infringements, the crates.io team will respect the legal decisions of the Rust Foundation as the official legal entity providing the crates.io service.

Package Ownership
crates.io has a first-come, first-serve policy on crate names. Upon publishing a package, the publisher will be made owner of the package on crates.io.

If you want to take over a package, we recommend you try and contact the current owner directly. If the current owner agrees, they can add you as an owner of the crate, and you can then remove them, if necessary. For security reasons, the crates.io team will not transfer ownership of existing crates without the explicit approval of the current owner.

If you are the author of a crate that another person wants to take over: keep in mind that the new owner might develop your crate in a way you never intended it, or might completely repurpose your crate. Transferring a crate to a malicious user could have a significant impact for any existing users of your crate.

Crate owners can delete their crates under certain conditions: the crate has been published for less than 72 hours, or the crate only has a single owner, the crate has been downloaded less than 1000 times for each month it has been published, and the crate is not depended upon by any other crate on crates.io. If these conditions are not met, the crate will not be deleted. In exceptional cases crate owners may contact the crates.io team to request deletion of a crate that does not meet these conditions.

The crates.io team may delete crates from the registry that do not comply with the policies on this document. In larger cases of squatting attacks this may happen without prior notification to the author, but in most cases the team will first give the author the chance to justify the purpose of the crate.

Data Access
Details on how to access the crates.io data can be found on the dedicated Data Access Policy page.

Security
Please see the Security page.

Sexually Obscene Content
We do not tolerate content associated with sexual exploitation or abuse of another individual, including where minors are concerned. We do not allow sexually themed or suggestive content that serves little or no purpose other than to solicit an erotic or shocking response, particularly where that content is amplified by its placement in profiles or other social contexts.

This includes:

Pornographic content
Non-consensual intimate imagery
Graphic depictions of sexual acts including photographs, video, animation, drawings, computer-generated images, or text-based content
We recognize that not all nudity or content related to sexuality is obscene. We may allow visual and/or textual depictions in artistic, educational, historical or journalistic contexts, or as it relates to victim advocacy. In some cases a disclaimer can help communicate the context of the project.

Violations and Enforcement
crates.io retains full discretion to take action in response to a violation of these policies, including account suspension, account termination, or removal of content.

We will however not be proactively monitoring the site for these kinds of violations, but instead relying on the community to draw them to our attention.

While the majority of interactions between individuals in the Rust community falls within our policies, violations of those policies do occur at times. When they do, the crates.io team may need to take enforcement action to address the violations. In all cases, content and account deletion is permanent and there is no basis to reverse these moderation actions taken by the crates.io team. Account suspension may be lifted at the team's discretion however, for example in the case of someone's account being compromised.

Reporting
Please report violations of this policy to help@crates.io.
